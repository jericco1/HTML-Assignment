        <p style="text-align: center;">Drama is an ancient Greek word that means act or deed. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle used this term in his book title the Poetics. In this text, he grouped different forms of poetry according to basic features he thought could be commonly recognized in their composition. He used Drama to explain poetic compositions that were acted in front of the audience in a theatron. Drama is one of the best literary forms through which dramatists can speak directly to their readers or audience, above all receiving quick feedback from the audience. Drama is a mode of fictional representation through dialogue and performance. Dramatist oftentimes use their characters, as vehicle to pass their thoughts, values, such as poets do with persona, and novelists do with narrators. In drama, the characters live out a storyline without the author making any comments, which gives the audience a direct presentation of charactersâ€™ life experiences. Because drama uses spoken words and dialogues, therefore their language usage plays a vital role, as it may give an idea to their feelings, personalities, background and change in feelings etc. The society is made up of people with distinct characteristics, attitudes, idiosyncrasies, ideologies and so on. Notwithstanding, these people are bound by common interests, beliefs, values, norms, traditions and above all culture. This is what distinguishes man from animals, as we know how to conduct ourselves and most times think alike. But like every society there is the zeal to move forward and do things differently, try new things, thereby knowingly or unknowingly breaking the laid down rules and regulations that binds and unites us all. This paves way to different social-political and moral imbalance as everyone wants to try new things to see how it affects them and the society at large. The result of which is never commendable and it could lead to the discovery of something spectacular or nefarious. Man needs are never ending, and as a result would do anything just to achieve an aim or make a statement not minding who is at the receiving end of it.

<p style="text-align: center;">Over the years, the Nigerian drama has been used as a tool to advocate for a change in the country. Some dramatists and theatre practitioners have used it as a weapon to fight the <b> colonial masters, the military regime, corrupt</b> political office holders and to advocate for peace and nation building. The idea of drama shapes our attitudes toward our lifestyles because; it brings people and situations under a <strong>spotlight</strong> . That is why dramatists such as Hagher use it to fight corruption in the society through his illumination of societal decadence. Commenting on his dramatic text Mulkin Matasa, a play that encourages youth to come out and take their country back from corrupt leaders and make a change that will foster unity and togetherness. He maintains that "a nation tottering and hanging on the cliff must <del>summon</del> <ins>awaken</ins> its reserve energy reposed in the youth"(3). <i>The societies needs the youth in taking leadership roles</i> in the community and not leave it at the mercies of those that have nothing to offer. <em>He further assert that</em> "the youth must urgently disengage from the myths of religion and the myth of <mark>ethnicity</mark> that stigmatizes the other so as to tender him or her <small>odious</small> and be pitilessly victimized"(3). What Hagher is trying to say, is that the youth should relegate the fact that reli<sub>gion</sub> and ethni<sup>city</sup> has made us a different person. </p>
